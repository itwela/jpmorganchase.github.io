My contrabutions to jpmorganchase.github.io and Perspective
===========================================================

here is a readme of the software engineering program I complety via forage for Jp Morgan
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This program was 3 parts with a fourth optional part and the parts included: 

- Task 1: Interface with a stock price data feed
- -Task 2: Use JPMorgan Chase & Co. frameworks and tools
- Task 3: Display data visually for traders
- Task 4: Bonus task: Open source contribution

Our tasks were given to us in tickets and we had to submit our changes via GitHub when completed. This project gave me valuable experience working with my first open source technologies, added python and even typescript experience. After all was said and done we received a certification from Forage and Jp Morgan! My first of many!
